# Project Overview

This project involves developing a simple React application that displays a table of user data using the `ag-grid-react` library. 

## Features to Implement

1. **Search Capability**:
    - Implement a search feature that filters the grid data based on user input do not use the ag-grid built in search system for this.
    - The search should be dynamic, filtering the grid as the user types.
    - Implement a dropdown  that allows users to choose the field (column) they want to search within (e.g., First Name, Last Name, Email).

2. **Conditional Column Display**:
    - By default, the IP address column should not be visible.
      - On click, the ip address column should toggle between visible and hidden.

3. **Cell Formatting**
    - Format the balance field to display as currency (e.g., $1,000.00).

4. **Styling**:
    - We are not looking for a pixel-perfect design, use styled-components to pass props to change colors, font-sizes, etc.

5. **Typescript**:
   - Use of typescript is not required but is a bonus.

## Development Setup

**Running the Application**:
    The project can be run locally using `npm run dev` after installing dependencies with `npm install`.

## Task Assignment

- Begin by setting up the project structure and installing necessary dependencies.
- Implement the grid display using `AgGridReact` with the initial set of columns.
